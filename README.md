# Hi 👋 I'm Justin

## Engineer

As a child, my two favorite subjects were math and literature. I believe my interest in programming comes from the unique way it combines these two fields, using mathematics to solve problems through the medium of code.

I've been working on the **Figma monetization team** recently, building out request access flows and scaling our payments model.

Outside of software development, I love to ski, bike, run, and play soccer.
