# Hi 👋 I'm Justin

## Engineer

As a kid, I loved math and literature — to me, software engineering is the perfect union of solving problems with logic and expressing those ideas simply through the medium of language.

I've been working on the **Figma monetization team** recently, building out request access flows and scaling our payments model.

Outside of software development, I love to ski, bike, run, and play soccer.
